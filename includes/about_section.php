              After taking reviews from students, we came to an  observation that students were facing problems  of finding all the study material and the upcomming events list at one place. Also , they were facing problems to  see their marks of previous semesters and midsem so that they can compare their previous and current sem or mid marks.

             So we got an idea to make a proper platform for the students as well as for faculties where students can find everything at one place. Also Faculties will have the option to add study materials so that it becomes easy for students to find it. The another feature will be that the students can compare themselves with the another students.
